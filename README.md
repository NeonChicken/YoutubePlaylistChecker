# YoutubePlaylistChecker
Replit repo to check which videos have been removed, unlisted or added in a YouTube playlist.

# THIS PROJECT ONLY WORKS IN REPLIT!
1. Get a YouTube API key
2. Add your key as a replit secrets file 
   (extra explanation on line 14 in main.py)
3. Add your youtube playlist ID to line 30 in main.py -> playlistId = ''
   (Your playlist ID is what comes after youtube.com/playlist?list=)
5. Run the first scan, ignore the console output for now.
Congrats! You are now set to scan unlisted videos titles the next time you run this program!
